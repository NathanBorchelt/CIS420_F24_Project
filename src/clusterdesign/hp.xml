    Syntax:
    
    <include>filename.xml</include> 
    Includes a file
    
    <item par1="val1" par2="val2" ...>ItemName</item>
    Inserts a vertex with specified parameters
    
    <place to-partition="PartName">ItemName</place>
    Places a copy of the specified item to the specified partition
    
    <edge from=<from-vertex> [from-partition=<part>] [to=<to-vertex>] [to-partition=<part>] />
    It connects <from-vertex> to <to-vertex>. If "to-partition" is specified as an optional argument,
    then a copy of a vertex specified in "to" is created first in "to-partition", and it is this copy that is connected.
    If "from-partition" is specified, a copy of "from" is connected, too, but it must exist beforehand.
    If "to" is not specified, it is considered to be equal to "from".

    <connect ( from="F" | from-partition="FP" ) ( to="T" | to-partition="TP" ) />
    Connects two partitions, in all-to-all manner, or a vertex to a partition, or a partition to a vertex.
    For connecting two vertices, use <edge>.
