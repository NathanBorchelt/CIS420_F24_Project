    <!-- Important! This switch has 34 ports; 16 are always connected to blade servers in the enclosure where the switch is installed,
         the remaining 18 are available with QSFP connectors and go to the outside, to other switches. However, the network design tool
         does not understand that ports are not all the same and tries to split 34 ports into two halves, with 17 ports going to
         servers and the other 17 going outside. We specify the number of ports as 32 to cater to the network design tool (until it
         becomes smarter), but keep in mind that you have two more ports for your own usage. -->
